## SAFR-E-IMAN (Travel & Tour Web App) | Built with Next.js and Tailwind.

A travel & tour Next.js app which provides Real-time updates, New
Offers, and Easy Booking Processes leading to more sales for the
Travel agency.

## Contribution

In this project, I contributed in migrating a React.js app into a
Next.js app to improve its SEO and fixed some bugs on Frontend
side to make User Interference more friendly.
